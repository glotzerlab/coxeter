"""Provide tools for generating shapes.

Shape families are coxeter's way of providing well-defined methods for
generating classes of shapes according to some set of rules. The basic
interface is defined by the :class:`~.ShapeFamily`, which is a functor that is
called to generate a shape. The :class:`~.TabulatedShapeFamily` group of
subclasses enable the generation of shape families according to some
tabulated set of data, while other families are defined by some set of
(discrete or continuous) parameters that are used to construct a shape
analytically.

The `DOI_SHAPE_REPOSITORIES` variable provides convenient access to the shape families
associated with different scientific publications. This dataset is useful for
reproducing the exact set of shapes from publications.

# Note for devs: we want this object to be documented in the public API. The Sphinx
# method for documenting a module-level constant is placing the docstring directly below
# it (as done below). However, if the variable is defined in a different module and then
# imported here, even putting it in __all__ doesn't lead to proper detection of the
# docstring by autodoc (you can get the variable documented, but it doesn't have the new
# docstring, just the docstring of its underlying type). As a result, we have to make it
# here.
