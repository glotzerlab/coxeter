        Moments are computed with respect to the :math:`x` and :math:`y`
        axes. In addition to the two planar moments, this property also
        provides the product of inertia.

        The `planar moments <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_moment_of_inertia>`__
        and the
        `product <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_moment_of_area#Product_moment_of_area>`__

                I_x &= {\int \int}_A y^2 dA \\
                I_y &= {\int \int}_A x^2 dA \\
                I_{xy} &= {\int \int}_A xy dA \\
            \end{align}

        To compute this for a polygon, we discretize the sum:

        .. math::
            \begin{align}
                I_x &= \frac{1}{12} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) (y_i^2 + y_i*y_{i+1} + y_{i+1}^2) \\
                I_y &= \frac{1}{12} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) (x_i^2 + x_i*x_{i+1} + x_{i+1}^2) \\
                I_{xy} &= \frac{1}{12} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) (x_i y_{i+1} + 2 x_i y_i + 2 x_{i+1} y_{i+1} + x_{i+1} y_i) \\
            \end{align}

        These formulas can be derived as described
        `here <https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/493736/moment-of-inertia-for-a-random-polygon>`__.

        Note that the moments are always calculated about an axis perpendicular
        to the polygon, i.e. the normal vector is aligned with the :math:`z`
        axis before the moments are calculated. This alignment should be
        considered when computing the moments for polygons embedded in
        three-dimensional space that are rotated out of the :math:`xy` plane,
        since the planar moments are invariant to this orientation. The exact

        The code in this function is based on implementation in :cite:`Dickinson2019`
        which is licensed under the BSD-3 license.

        Given a closed, possibly non-simple polygon described as a list of vertices in
        :math:`\mathbb{R}^2` and a point that doesn't lie directly on the path of the
        polygon, we'd like to compute the winding number of the polygon around the
        point. To achieve this, we place the point at the origin. Divide the remainder
        of the plane (i.e., :math:`\mathbb{R}^2` minus the origin) into two halves,
        :math:`L` and :math:`R`, defined as follows:

        .. math::
            L = {(x, y) | x < 0 \lor x = 0 \land y < 0}

            R = {(x, y) | x > 0 \lor x = 0 \land y > 0}

        That is, :math:`R` contains all points with argument in the half-closed
        interval :math:`\left[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)`, and :math:`L`
        contains all others.  Note that with these definitions, :math:`L` and :math:`R`
        are both convex: a line segment between two points in :math:`R` lies entirely
        in :math:`R`, and similarly for :math:`L`.  In particular, a line segment
        between two points can only pass through the origin if one of those points is
        in :math:`L` and the other in :math:`R`. Now, we follow the edges of the
        polygon, keeping track of how many times we move between :math:`L`
        and :math:`R`.  For each move from :math:`L` to :math:`R` (or vice versa),
        we also need to compute whether the edge passes *above* or *below* the origin,
        to compute its contribution to the total winding number.  From the comment
        above, we can safely ignore all edges that lie entirely within either :math:`L`
        or :math:`R`.

        .. note::

            Points on the boundary of the shape will return :code:`False`.
