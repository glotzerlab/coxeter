    A polyhedron is defined by a set of vertices and a set of faces
    composed of the vertices. On construction, the faces are reordered
    counterclockwise with respect to an outward normal. The polyhedron
    provides various standard geometric calculations, such as volume and
    surface area. Most features of the polyhedron can be accessed via
    properties, including the plane equations defining the faces and the
    neighbors of each face.

    .. note::

        For the purposes of calculations like moments of inertia, the
        polyhedron is assumed to be of constant, unit density.

            The vertices of the polyhedron.

            Whether or not the faces of the polyhedron are all convex.
            This is used to determine whether certain operations like
