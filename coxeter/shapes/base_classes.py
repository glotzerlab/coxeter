        In solid state physics,
        `scattering theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_theory>`__ is
        concerned with understanding the ways in which radiation is scattered from a
        sample. For a single point particle at position P, the the amplitude of a
        scattered wave observed at position Q is the product of the incoming wave
        amplitude (which follows the standard equation for a traveling wave) and the
        scattering density at P. For a crystal composed of many point particles, the
        intensity of the resulting superposition of waves can be identified as the
        Fourier transform of the total scattering density. When the particles are not
        point particles, the scattering density of the particles in their local
        coordinate systems are no longer identical. Conveniently, this component is
        separable in the Fourier transform of the total density; as a result, the
        scattering scattering intensity can be decomposed into two terms, the Fourier
        transform of the distribution of scatterers and the Fourier transform of each
        scatterer in its local coordinate system. The first term is known as the
        `static structure factor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_factor>`__
        :math:`S(\vec{q})` and describes the spatial distribution of scatterers, while
        the second term is called the
        `form factor <http://gisaxs.com/index.php/Form_Factor>`__
        :math:`f(\vec{q})` and describes the local scattering profile.

        While the form factor (the scattering intensity) can be measured from
        diffraction experiments, the Fourier transform of a single particle cannot.
        However, it can be computed theoretically for a known scattering volume and can
        be inserted directly into the expression for the total scattering intensity.
        This local profile directly describes the wave emitted from a single scatterer
        (in reciprocal space) and is known as the form factor amplitude. This function
        computes the form factor amplitude for a given wavevector :math:`q`.
