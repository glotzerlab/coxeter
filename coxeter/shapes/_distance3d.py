    '''
    Solves for the shortest displacement between points and the surface of a polyhedron.

    This function calculates the shortest displacement by partitioning the space around 
    a polyhedron into zones: vertex, edge, and face. Determining the zone(s) a 
    point lies in, determines the displacement calculation(s) done. For a vertex zone,
    the displacement is calculated between a point and the vertex. For an edge zone, the 
    displacement is calculated between a point and the edge. For a face zone, the 
    displacement is calculated between a point and the face. Zones are allowed to overlap, 
    and points can be in more than one zone. By taking the minimum of all the distances of
    the calculated displacements, the shortest displacements are found.

    Args:
        points (list or np.ndarray): positions of the points [shape = (n_points, 3)]
        translation_vector (list or np.ndarray): translation vector of the polyhedron [shape = (3,)]

    Returns:
