Source code
-----------

**coxeter** includes the source code of the following Python packages and
modules.

.. highlight:: none

The source of polytri (https://github.com/bjorkegeek/polytri) is included
directly into the **coxeter** package. The module implementing that code is
reproduced in its entirety along with an additional ``__init__`` file to enable
its import as a subpackage. It is used for the triangulation of polygons and
the surface triangulation of polyhedra. This software is made available under
