Prisms
=====================

Any of the infinite family of right uniform antiprisms can be generated with :code:`families.UniformPrismFamily.get_shape(n)`, where ``n`` is the number of vertices of the polar faces. A subset of this family is shown below.

For implementation details see :py:class:`~coxeter.families.UniformPrismFamily`.
