Pyramids and Dipyramids
=======================

Coxeter includes pre-defined shape data for 6 members of the infinite Pyramid-Dipyramid family, each of which can be instantiated using :code:`families.PyramidDipyramidFamily.get_shape(\<name\>)`. Some may also be found among the :doc:`Johnson Solids<table-other>` from :cite:`Damasceno2012a`.

For implementation details see :py:class:`~coxeter.families.PyramidDipyramidFamily`.
