Prisms and Antiprisms
=====================

Coxeter includes pre-defined shape data for 16 members of the infinite Prism-Antiprism family, each of which can be instantiated using :code:`families.PrismAntiprismFamily.get_shape(\<name\>)`. Some may also be found among the :doc:`Other Polyhedra<table-other>` from :cite:`Damasceno2012a`.

For implementation details see :py:class:`~coxeter.families.PrismAntiprismFamily`.

Shape information is listed in the following tables.
