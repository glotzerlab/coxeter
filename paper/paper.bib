    abstract = {Predicting structure from the attributes of a material's building blocks remains a challenge and central goal for materials science. Isolating the role of building block shape for self-assembly provides insight into the ordering of molecules and the crystallization of colloids, nanoparticles, proteins, and viruses. We investigated 145 convex polyhedra whose assembly arises solely from their anisotropic shape. Our results demonstrate a remarkably high propensity for thermodynamic self-assembly and structural diversity. We show that from simple measures of particle shape and local order in the fluid, the assembly of a given shape into a liquid crystal, plastic crystal, or crystal can be predicted.},

It has been actively developed since March 2007 and available open source since August 2008. HOOMD-blue is a Python package with a high performance C++/CUDA backend that we built from the ground up for GPU acceleration. The Python interface allows users to combine HOOMD-blue with other packages in the Python ecosystem to create simulation and analysis workflows. We employ software engineering practices to develop, test, maintain, and expand the code.},

    abstract = {Packings of hard polyhedra have been studied for centuries due to their mathematical aesthetic and more recently for their applications in fields such as nanoscience, granular and colloidal matter, and biology. In all these fields, particle shape is important for structure and properties, especially upon crowding. Here, we explore packing as a function of shape. By combining simulations and analytic calculations, we study three 2-parameter families of hard polyhedra and report an extensive and systematic analysis of the densest packings of more than 55,000 convex shapes. The three families have the symmetries of triangle groups (icosahedral, octahedral, tetrahedral) and interpolate between various symmetric solids (Platonic, Archimedean, Catalan). We find that optimal (maximum) packing density surfaces that reveal unexpected richness and complexity, containing as many as 130 different structures within a single family. Our results demonstrate the utility of thinking of shape not as a static property of an object in the context of packings, but rather as but one point in a higher dimensional shape space whose neighbors in that space may have identical or markedly different packings. Finally, we present and interpret our packing results in a consistent and generally applicable way by proposing a method to distinguish regions of packings and classify types of transitions between them.},

    abstract = {We introduce a mean-field theoretical framework for generalizing isotropic pair potentials to anisotropic shapes. This method is suitable for generating pair potentials that can be used in both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate the application of this theory by deriving a Lennard-Jones (LJ)-like potential for arbitrary geometries along with a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson-like repulsive variant, showing that the resulting potentials behave very similarly to standard LJ potentials while also providing a nearly conformal mapping of the underlying shape. We then describe an implementation of this potential in the simulation engine HOOMD-blue and discuss the challenges that must be overcome to achieve a sufficiently robust and performant implementation. The resulting potential can be applied to smooth geometries like ellipsoids and to convex polytopes. We contextualize these applications with reference to the existing methods for simulating such particles. The pair potential is validated using standard criteria, and its performance is compared to existing methods for comparable simulations. Finally, we show the results of self-assembly simulations, demonstrating that this method can be used to study the assembly of anisotropic particles into crystal structures.},

These new particles are poised to become the 'atoms' and 'molecules' of tomorrow's materials if they can be successfully assembled into useful structures. Here, we discuss the recent progress made in the synthesis of nanocrystals and colloidal particles and draw analogies between these new particulate building blocks and better-studied molecules and supramolecular objects. We argue for a conceptual framework for these new building blocks based on anisotropy attributes and discuss the prognosis for future progress in exploiting anisotropy for materials design and assembly.},
