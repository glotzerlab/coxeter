    abstract = {Predicting structure from the attributes of a material's building blocks remains a challenge and central goal for materials science. Isolating the role of building block shape for self-assembly provides insight into the ordering of molecules and the crystallization of colloids, nanoparticles, proteins, and viruses. We investigated 145 convex polyhedra whose assembly arises solely from their anisotropic shape. Our results demonstrate a remarkably high propensity for thermodynamic self-assembly and structural diversity. We show that from simple measures of particle shape and local order in the fluid, the assembly of a given shape into a liquid crystal, plastic crystal, or crystal can be predicted.},

    abstract = {Packings of hard polyhedra have been studied for centuries due to their mathematical aesthetic and more recently for their applications in fields such as nanoscience, granular and colloidal matter, and biology. In all these fields, particle shape is important for structure and properties, especially upon crowding. Here, we explore packing as a function of shape. By combining simulations and analytic calculations, we study three 2-parameter families of hard polyhedra and report an extensive and systematic analysis of the densest packings of more than 55,000 convex shapes. The three families have the symmetries of triangle groups (icosahedral, octahedral, tetrahedral) and interpolate between various symmetric solids (Platonic, Archimedean, Catalan). We find that optimal (maximum) packing density surfaces that reveal unexpected richness and complexity, containing as many as 130 different structures within a single family. Our results demonstrate the utility of thinking of shape not as a static property of an object in the context of packings, but rather as but one point in a higher dimensional shape space whose neighbors in that space may have identical or markedly different packings. Finally, we present and interpret our packing results in a consistent and generally applicable way by proposing a method to distinguish regions of packings and classify types of transitions between them.},

    abstract = {We introduce a mean-field theoretical framework for generalizing isotropic pair potentials to anisotropic shapes. This method is suitable for generating pair potentials that can be used in both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate the application of this theory by deriving a Lennard-Jones (LJ)-like potential for arbitrary geometries along with a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson-like repulsive variant, showing that the resulting potentials behave very similarly to standard LJ potentials while also providing a nearly conformal mapping of the underlying shape. We then describe an implementation of this potential in the simulation engine HOOMD-blue and discuss the challenges that must be overcome to achieve a sufficiently robust and performant implementation. The resulting potential can be applied to smooth geometries like ellipsoids and to convex polytopes. We contextualize these applications with reference to the existing methods for simulating such particles. The pair potential is validated using standard criteria, and its performance is compared to existing methods for comparable simulations. Finally, we show the results of self-assembly simulations, demonstrating that this method can be used to study the assembly of anisotropic particles into crystal structures.},

	Abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

We find that the kinetics of orientational and positional ordering can be manipulated by changing the shape of the colloids: ellipsoids with aspect ratio 2.0 melt into disordered structures 5.7 times faster compared to spheres. On the other hand{,} ellipsoids self-assemble into ordered crystals at a similar rate to spheres. Confocal microscopy is used to directly visualize defects in the self-assembled structures. Small-angle light scattering (SALS) quantifies the light diffraction response{,} which is sensitive to the kinetics of positional and orientational ordering in the self-assembled anisotropic structures. We find three different light diffraction patterns: a phase with high orientational order (with chain-like structure in real space){,} a phase with high positional and orientational order (characteristic of a close-packed structure){,} and a phase that is disordered in position but with intermediate orientational order. The large influence of aspect ratio on the kinetics of the positionally and orientationally ordered phase is explored through simulation; it is found that the number of particle degrees of freedom controls the difference between the melting rates of the ellipsoids and spheres. This research contributes to the understanding of reconfiguration kinetics and optical properties of colloidal crystals produced from anisotropic colloids."}
